LogisimCircuits
===============

###A series of logisim circuits completed for computer architecture. Includes rudimentary circuits that are comprised in an ALU and CPU.

The following gif demonstrates a 4-bit ALU circuit with a OR, NOT, AND, and Addition unit.

The 4 bit ALU is capable of calculating integer values between 0 and 31(inclusive) as long as overflower bit is observed(c4). 4 bit ALUs without overflow outputs can only generate integer values from 0 and 15(inclusive). 

To run each circuit, you must download the logisim software by ozark.
